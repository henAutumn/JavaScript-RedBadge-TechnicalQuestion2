# Red Badge Technical Interview Question #2
---
run npm install 

create a local db call redbadgequestion

connect to that db

npm run dev 

run npm install -g sequelize-cli

run sequelize db:seed:all

*if running the prior command fails, run '.\node_modules\.bin\sequelize db:seed:all'

This will use the cli that is installed already in your node_modules.

### What you will be creating 

A clone for REI's website here [link](https://www.rei.com/).

Specifically we are going to be recreating two pages:

- landing/splash page 
- product page. 

The images of what each of these pages look like are in the images folder. 

- spash1 image has the navbars 
- section 1 -3 should be on the splash page 
- footer should be in the footer file
- product page 1 - 3 has all of the sections you need to create on that page

### House Keeping

- Going out of scope with the problem is also not needed, granted when you finish with the solution and have  more time, feel free to add extras. 
- Stick to the MVP of the problem.
- Read the code as it will give you coding clues.
- Come in with a level head and try not to over think it.
